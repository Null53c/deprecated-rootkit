# deprecated-rootkit
Very small usermode rootkit. Nice FASM src of basic ring 3 rootkit its old and somewhat spaghetti but it has no more use to me. 

While this may be helpful to some. The intent of this rootkit is for educational purposes. Do not use it maliciously. I can not be held responsible for any error or negligence derived therefrom, you use it at your own risk.
